    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I am a Director-Research, NLP in the AI Labs, which is a part of the R&D division at Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, NJ. I supervise a group of NLP and speech scientists working on various educational research areas.</p>
    <p>Before coming to ETS, I was a Research Scientist at Siemens Corporate Research (SCR), Princeton, New Jersey. At SCR, I worked on lexical semantics and relationship mining, amongst other things. I received my PhD from the Computer Science department of the University of Pittsburgh and my MSE in Computer Science from the Johns Hopkins University.</p>
    <p>My primary research areas are NLP and AI. I am interested in many aspects of Natural Language Processing like subjectivity and sentiment analysis, discourse, dialogs, narratives, question answering and generation.</p>
    <p>At ETS, I continue to work on these and many other aspects of language with my colleagues, applying them specifically for the task of automated assessments and content generation.</p>
